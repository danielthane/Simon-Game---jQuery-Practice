# Simon Says Game!

This is a "Boss Level" Challenge from the Udemy course I'm currently working on.

The project gave me the HTML and CSS, tasking me with writing the javascript!
As I had been studying jQuery recently I thought I'd give this a go and seems to have turned out relatively well.

## Potential Future Imporvements

- After studying backend, I'd look to implement a basic database to handle highscores.
- Increasing/decresing the number of buttons as the level goes up.
